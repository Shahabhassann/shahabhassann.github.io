      <h2> Before Code </h2>
      <p>Before learning code, I was in the field as a graphic designer. This passion stemmed from my 
      passion for the visual arts. Though recently i have been peaked by the recent things i learned 
      the coding field can do for me. I can learn HTML and CSS and further my career in front end,
      as well as knowing the back end field, making me a full stack developer. </p>
